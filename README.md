An AI agent that transforms vague ideas into actionable project plans through
natural conversation.

## Overview

Trellis acts as a personal project manager, breaking down complex goals and
ambiguous thoughts into structured, sprint-based road maps. Through natural
language interaction, it helps clarify task requirements, identify dependencies,
and create comprehensive action plans with priority levels and time estimates.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Capabilities
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands vague, high-level project
  descriptions
- **Interactive Clarification**: Asks smart questions to extract hidden
  requirements
- **Sprint Planning**: Automatically organizes tasks into manageable sprints
- **Smart Estimation**: Provides effort estimates based on task complexity
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identifies and visualizes task relationships
- **Priority Tagging**: Assigns priority levels (P0-P3) based on context and
  deadlines
- **Task Breakdown**: Breaks large tasks into subtasks or Pomodoro sessions
- **Memory & Context**: Remembers past projects and user preferences

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama LLMs
- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly connects with project management tools
- **Adaptive Communication**: Adjusts tone from casual brainstorming to formal
  documentation
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves planning accuracy based on user feedback
- **Context Awareness**: Remembers project history and user preferences through
  vector storage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- LLM provider (at least one of):
  - Ollama running locally
  - OpenAI API key
  - Anthropic API key
- Weaviate for memory storage

### Installation
```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/jrwinget/trellis.git
cd trellis

# install dependencies
pip install -e .

# set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your provider choice and credentials
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# start the server
python -m apps.server.main

# in another terminal, use the CLI
trellis plan "I want to build a mobile app for tracking habits"
```

## Usage Examples

### CLI Interface
```bash
# basic planning
trellis plan "Create a portfolio website"

# save plan to a file
trellis plan "Redesign the user dashboard" --output plan.json

# show version
trellis version
```

### API Usage
```python
# using the API directly
import httpx

response = httpx.post(
    "http://localhost:7315/plan",
    json={"message": "Build a task management app"}
)

sprints = response.json()
```
